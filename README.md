# binary_search_go
This repo is coding practice for binary search

## Notes

For binary search, think about what is the object that I would like to 
search, and try to keep the potential objects (l > r) in range.

Use while (l > r), so that then there is only one answer, the loop will exit.
Then we can evaluation whether this value is what we want.

Try to think about the extreme cases where all array is smarller and greater than the target, and when 
the array is empty.
